                    At the start of production, Bonsai ‘98 was something very different. Me and Mukund Narayan had gotten together in hopes of creating a project that would showcase our system design abilities and how we would be able to reuse systems in future projects. We’d originally thought of Bonsai ‘98 as a shop management game. One where you as the player would take care of your plants in a realistic manner, watching them grow and even manipulating the plants themselves. We’d started outlining all these deeper systems that would be at play simultaneously. We felt that players needed them to be captivated.<br /><br />

                    When we first showed the growth system to our some of our other colleagues, we had what could be described best as a “wow” moment. We found inspite of everything that people were content, even without any real game mechanics, to just watch their plant grow! People were glued to the screen for a solid 10 minutes, just watching some digital plants grow. I knew this was it.

                    A standout feature of Bonsai '98 is its dynamic procedural growth system, which has been a cornerstone of the game's vision since its inception where we’d envisioned giving the player freedom to shape and affect their plants and their growth. The system serves as the game's primary Unique Selling Point (USP), setting it apart from other titles in the genre. Entirely implemented in Blueprints, the growth system allows for a high degree of scalability and quick tweaking & editing.<br /><br />

                    A key goal of the system was for plants to be able to grow regardless of the root start position, even on uneven surfaces. On top of that we also wanted certain plants to have the ability to climb surfaces as well.
                    By designing the system to be modular and to be able to adapt dynamically based on each pieces properties, we achieved a level of flexibility that enhances the player experience and allows players to push their creativity further, as well as allowing us to quickly add, iterate, and even hotswap parts on plants.<br /><br />

                    One of the most exciting challenges in developing this feature was ensuring that it'd be performant. This was a bit of a challenge as everything was being created using Unreal’s blueprints and on top of that I’d never quite created a system like this.

                <p>
                    So a growth system that also allows every part of it to be manipulated and even pruned by the player, great! Now where do you even start?!<br /><br />

                    I ended up conducting a fair bit of research into not just how other titles handle growth mechanics in general but I also studied real world plants, for example the Lindenmayer system used for describing plant growth, or how their stems split, where and why they split, the consistency of plant specific patterns and their exceptions, and more.
                    I’m very passionate about plants and I’ve always been fascinated by them and the mechanics behind their growth. I’ve been growing and taking care of plants for a few years and as we’d started development in early spring of 2024 this gave me the perfect opportunity to study plant growth first hand.<br /><br />

                    I’d purchased a variety of plants, such as various chilis, wild strawberries, and even a wisteria sapling of which all were very interesting to observer and to note their various growth patterns and common features.
                    Every week I’d make it a routine to check on their growth and to note any potential distinguishing features, such as the ability to see on chili plants (as well as others) and primarily their stems where new “nodes” could be found that allow the plant to grow both new leaves as well as branches.<br /><br />


                    Early on I’d looked into the way a majority of games handle plant growth, for example mesh swapping or shape keys. But none of these satisfied me in terms of their flexibility. We wanted something more, something truly unique and special.<br /><br />

                    When I noticed those “nodes” on my chili plants I got a sort of eureka moment. I knew this was exactly what we needed! The only thing that remained was the implementation.

                <p>
                    The growth system is built around three key actors that work together to create dynamic and scalable procedural growth that mimics real plants to some extent.<br /><br />

                    - The Plant Master serves as the core of the system, managing overall growth logic and overseeing the construction of new branches. It stores crucial variables such as the total branch count, ensuring that growth remains balanced and controlled.<br /><br />

                    - The Branch Master is responsible for self-managing the individual growth behaviors of branches. It accounts for factors such as gravity, and growth direction while also handling pruning logic.<br /><br />

                    - The Socket Master governs the probability and placement of new branches. By determining where branches should emerge, as well as which branches have the possibility of spawning.<br /><br />

                    These three actors communicate closely to maintain seamless procedural growth. The system primarily uses Blueprint interfaces for actor interaction while also utilizing direct access to relevant data when necessary. This structure not only keeps the system modular and adaptable but also enables quick modifications to the underlying logic. Additionally, the setup allows for the easy introduction of specific plant and branch variations, giving us the flexibility to fine-tune growth behaviors and expand on unique mechanics as needed.

            <h3 class="project-contents-subsubtitle">PLANT MASTER</h3>
            <div class="project-page-info-description">
                <p>
                    The Plant Master serves as the foundation of the entire procedural growth system, acting as the core component that governs the creation and management of all plants in the world. It functions as the base structure, overseeing the initial placement and overall growth of the plant.<br /><br />

                    One of its primary responsibilities is storing key general values for its respective plant, including the total branch count, an array of available empty sockets, and variables such as growth speed.<br /><br />

                    When a plant base is placed into the world, whether through the editor or dynamically at runtime by a player, the default plant base socket is populated. At this point, the Plant Master initializes growth by attempting to construct new Branch Master actors until the plant reaches its max branch cap.<br /><br />

                    Additionally, the Plant Master is responsible for locating available empty sockets and signaling them through interface calls. This process instructs sockets to begin selecting and spawning viable branches based on predefined probability factors.<br /><br />

                    By centralizing core tree management within the Plant Master, the system remains flexible and modular, allowing for easy adjustments to growth logic, balance changes, and future expansions with new plant variations.

            <h2 class="project-contents-subtitle">SAVING</h2>
            <div class="project-page-info-description">
                <p>
                    One of the initial concerns we had regarding the creation and use of this system was how we were going to go about saving users plants and their creations. Saving these things was of course vital to making the gameplay work.<br /><br />

                    At first I wasn’t quite sure how to approach the problem. I’d never implemented proper saving into a game before, let alone a procedural growth system with multiple components that had to interplay correctly in a specific order. <br /><br />

                    But after taking some time to think about the problem and doing some quick research I was confident I’d got a fairly decent solution. Since everything within the game is contained in your pot that you create your scene within I could simply assign IDs to each actor in the hierarchy and also keep track of each actor’s parent’s ID as well. This effectively allows me to reconstruct the entire scenes hierarchy as needed.<br /><br />

                    To start, when creating any new actor, be it a prop the player can place or a new branch growing on the tree we simply generate it a new Globally unique identifier (GUID). When we eventually need to save the players diorama we can pull each actors respective GUID as well as their parent’s and write that to a save file. <br /><br />

                    Then upon loading it we can first just initialize all our saved actors and their positions & rotations etc, after which we can re-attach them by finding their parents thus recreating the original hierarchy. While I was initially concerned inregards to save and load times, I found through testing the initial implementation that they were negligible. Would I have liked to have a better more efficient system in place? Yes, absolutely. Would it be worth the extra production time? No, not at all.
                </p>

            <h2 class="project-contents-subtitle">TROUBLES AND PITFALLS</h2>
            <div class="project-page-info-description">
                <p>
                    Initially I had some trouble getting certain aspects of the growth system to work correctly. Namely the climbing was rather difficult as debugging my vector math in blueprints wasn’t exactly the most pleasant experience, and gravity was probably the most frustrating for a good few days. Even to this day there are some issues with branch settling that still need to be addressed.<br /><br />

                    With everything being done in blueprints there is of course quite a bit of overhead, and in general there are lots of quickly thrown in bits of blueprints that were meant to be temporary that have stuck around slowing things down. But arguably the biggest performance hog was that I’d ignorantly set up a double For Loop in the plant master when retrieving all empty available sockets to grow the next branch on when it wasn’t at all necessary. Once I uncovered this and quickly patched it we saw performance roughly triple. I have of course gone through and made other similar optimizations overtime.<br /><br />

                    Ideally I would’ve liked to rewrite the entire system in C++ for performance efficiency, although at the time I started developing it I didn’t have any extensive knowledge of C++, especially not integrating it with other things such as saving, and now we’re at a stage where the amount of refactoring required to re-intigrate a rewritten version would just be too high, and too big of a risk to the project.
